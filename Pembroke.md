A fortified manor house, with several dozen dwellings within its walls. The surrounding lands serve as pasture and farmland. Ruled by [[Sir Ceredig, The Gallows Knight]].

A weak harvest has lead to a widespread famine across the holding. Sir Ceredig, fearing revolt, has put down any who speak up.

## Relations
**With [[Aelyn's Gate]]**: Harmonious/Succesor  + Debt/Raids
**With [[Bannockbry]]**: Reluctant/Enemy  + Conquest/Occupation
**With [[Abbey of St. Maleor]]**: Sir Ceredig has recently offered the abbot, [[Father Avilius]], to inherit a small part of his lands, hoping to earn favor with the Divines. However, this has put him in bad standing with his own peoples.

Sir Ceredig's family, of Old Faith heritage, has long feuded with the abbots of the abbey. Ceredig's olive branch to Avilius is an attempt to reconcile this, though he might face consequences from his own family.
