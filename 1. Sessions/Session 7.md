## Plans
- Fled from the knights of the [[4. Myth of the Order|Order of St. Lymond]] under the cover of night.
- Ran deep into the night, hoping the knights lose their track.
- Likely to be searching for shelter somewhere, perhaps the [[Abbey of St. Maleor]].
## Details

## Recap
- Spent some time recovering at the [[Abbey of St. Maleor]]. Learnt more about the relation between the abbey and the [[4. Myth of the Order|Order of St. Lymond]].
- Learnt abut the missing relic, the Beseecher's Sinister Hand. 
- Ventured out, encountered  [[The Needle Seer]] at the [[Canyon Vista]]. They showed three visions, in truth of events that can no longer occur:
	- The monk-thief hid the relic under his bed, where it was found next morning -— Impossible because the relic was traded to the Order of St. Lymond.
	- The monk-thief confesses to the theft in an ecclesiastical court — Impossible because the monk killed himself a few weeks later, before the players arrived.
	- The players encounter the relic at the Order's stronghold — Impossible because they fled captivity.
- Encountered Gruff in the mushroom forests beyond the mountains, who explained they are builders and she has come to explore the surface world.
