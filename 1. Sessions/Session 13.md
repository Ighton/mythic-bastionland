## Plans

## The Battle
- Assume the battle takes 45 minutes, the duel takes 30 minutes, and allow another 45 minutes for wrapping up. So start 21:15 at the latest.
- Once the troops lie defeated, a few remaining knights and the grandmaster will demand a final honorable skirmish. 
- They can choose to either capture the grandmaster (and earn a great ransom) or slay him, and end the order permanently.
- Perhaps [[Sir Elgan]], the wight, shows up?
- Or [[Sir Derwyn, The Fox Knight]], leading a sortie from Bannockbry?
