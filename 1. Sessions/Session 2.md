## Plans
- It is the middle of spring (Jun 16, Year 4).
- Players will head out to the west, in order to search for the "monster" that has been sighted around [[Aelyn's Gate]] ([[1. Myth of the Wyvern]]).

## Recruiting in Aelyn's Gate
- [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight|Lady Deryn]] needs [[Prince Eurion, The Emerald Knight|Prince Eurion]] dealt with before she can send a regiment with them.
- The sherrif of Aelyn's Gate has been unsuccessful in persuading her to sent out a party to hunt for the beast.

## Recap
- All three set out towards the western crags, searching for the Wyvern's nest.
- Encountered the Thorn Seer in 0301 ([[2. Myth of the Fortress]], Omen 1). She spoke of the end times and a gargantuan invasion.
- Encountered Burial Mound in 0302 ([[1. Myth of the Wyvern]], Omen 2). By trading a bone, Sir Crabbe learnt that a village stood here generations ago. Now, only the burial mound remains. During the investigation, they saw the Wyvern duck away between the crags on the horizon.
- Encountered Derwyn the Squire and his dead liege Sir Gowene in 0201 ([[1. Myth of the Wyvern]], Omen 3). Camped with Derwyn and the corpse of Sir Gowene.
- Refused to take Derwyn to safety. He could either wait, travel with them to seek the wyvern. The body of Sir Gowene was left amidst the crags.
- They got trapped in the crags, as violent winds made it impossible to navigate the treacherous canyons.
- When they returned to [[Aelyn's Gate]] a day after Derwyn arrived, they learnt he had arrived safely and had been resting.
- They spoke to Father Rhys, the court chaplain, looking for religious materials. They performed a sacrament honoring Sir Gowene. Promised to take gold from Father Rhys to the [[Abbey of St. Maleor]].
