## Details
- [[Prince Eurion, The Emerald Knight|Prince Eurion]] signs a letter to fellow knights, demanding they ride.
- At Pembroke, only a small regiment of militia is available.
- At Aelyn's Gate, [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight|Lady Deryn]] offers a band of skirmishers, and optionally a band of mercenaries for hire at the local tavern.
