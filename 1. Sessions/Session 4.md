## Downtime
## [[The Carved Seer]]
- Meet the carved seer at the [[Silent Grove]].
- The lush morass is quiet, except for the pained groans of the seer.
- Tied to two giant oaks with iron chains, the carved seer kneels on the ground. Acolytes tend to him with cloths, water.
- Seer warns them of an attack on [[Aelyn's Gate]] if they fail to slay the wyvern. "The death of the Judge"
- But: "Though it fears no steel nor shield, to the wail of unstained soul it does yield."
