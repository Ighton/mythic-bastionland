## Plans
- Players arrived in [[Bannockbry]] a few days earlier.
- They've been invited to dinner by [[Prince Eurion, The Emerald Knight]], in honor of [[Sceptremas]].
- It is midspring (approx early june). 
- Eurion informs the players that news has reached him about a great beast attacking [[Aelyn's Gate]]. He suggests they pay it a visit.
