## Plans
- Dinner at [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight]]'s estate in [[Aelyn's Gate]]. It is fine. She is courteous, but cold.
- Her Marshal and several courtiers enter, carrying a dead stag (Omen 1, [[1. Myth of the Wyvern]])
- Lady Deryn orders the Company to find whatever creature did this, and slay it.
