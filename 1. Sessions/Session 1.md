## Plans
- Players arrived in [[Bannockbry]] a few days earlier.
- They've been invited to dinner by [[Prince Eurion, The Emerald Knight]], in honor of [[Sceptremas]].
- It is midspring (approx early june). 
- During dinner, a funeral procession for the Moth Knight enters the great halls.
- She has demanded to be buried here, in the keep her ancestors once ruled. The coat of arms on her shield is similar to one depicted in the great hall.
