## Plans
*A season has passed, it is late summer*
- **Sir Turnbucke:** Scout the siege
- **Lady Tressara:** Make favor with mercenaries
- **Sir Foxter:** Help the wight, Sir Elgan
- **Sir Crabbe:** Acquire gear from blacksmiths
## The preparation
- The siege consists of four regiments. They have blockaded the city since middle-spring. They have built an extensive encampment including fortifications. A sortie from the city was slain.
- They are a regiment of skirmishers, a regiment of mercenaries, a regiment of riders, and an order of knights
- An ecclesiastical tent holds the Sinister Hand of the Beseecher, the relic that the order stole. They pray to it, seeking power.
- They have built their camp in an open plain. They have little defense from attack, but are outside the range of arrows from the walls, and archers coming from behind have little places to fire from safely.
- For a Coin, bribe a guard for information or allow entry (once) into Bannockbry.
---
- The mercenaries are [[The Banner of the Red Hawk]], a mercenary order from a distant land. They fight under [[Sir Croyle]], a cunning tactician. He is slow to trust, but a warm friend.
- Becoming friends with the mercenaries costs a Coin. 
---
- All together, the party will be able to acquire a band of militia from [[Pembroke]], a regiment of skirmishers and a regiment of mercenaries from [[Aelyn's Gate]], and another regiment of mercenaries from [[The Banner of the Red Hawk]]. Each regiment costs a Coin to upkeep, except the mercenaries, who cost two Coin.
---
- The blacksmiths will gladly help out with gear.
- For a single coin, grant a Coat, a Helm, or a Weapon.
- For two coin, grant a Coat, Plates and a helm, or a Coat, a helm and a weapon.
- For three coin, grant all four.
---
- The wight, [[Sir Elgan]], is struggling with his past. He will insist for a long time that his soul is doomed for hell, and that all he wishes to do is die in peace. He knows there is no redemption.
- If persuaded, he might initiate a lonesome assault on the camp, weakening the regiments or destroying supplies. This will hurt the regiments starting health.

## The Journey
- Journey can be quick if desired, or interject myths and troubles if a longer stretch is needed. 
## The Battle
- Assume the battle takes 45 minutes, the duel takes 30 minutes, and allow another 45 minutes for wrapping up. So start 21:15 at the latest.
- Once the troops lie defeated, a few remaining knights and the grandmaster will demand a final honorable skirmish. 
- They can choose to either capture the grandmaster (and earn a great ransom) or slay him, and end the order permanently.
