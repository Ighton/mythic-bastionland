## Plans
- Confronted by [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight|Lady Deryn]] about abandoning Derwyn the squire.
- Players will head out to the west, in order to search for the "monster" that has been sighted around [[Aelyn's Gate]] ([[1. Myth of the Wyvern]]).
## Deryn's lesson
- Knights are summoned early in the morning to the castle forge. There, Lady Deryn is working, wearing a simple wool tunic and apron.
- She explains that blades must be tempered - strengthened, so that they will not fail in battle.
- She continues that a knight is to be the wall between the weak and the world. Word had reached her ears that the boy had been left by them.
- To leave a corpse of a sacred knight behind, to be scavenged by beasts, to let the boy wander the mountains alone, is unbefitting of any knight of this realm.
- If they will not be the wall they are charged to be, then neither will she.
- They are banished from this castle until they return with the head of the wyvern.
## Recap
- Players were scorned by [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight|Lady Deryn]], who taught the players the meaning of their oath, and scolded them for their failure to uphold it by leaving [[Squire Derwyn]] alone.
- Returned out, encountered wyvern eggs, which hatched at midnight.
- Recovered the body of Sir Gowene.
- Upon returning, Sir Crabbe (Tim) urged [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight|Lady Deryn]] to investigate the corpses of the Wyvern young. She scolded him for bringing the young into the city walls. Subsequently, they were banished from the holding until they returned with the wyvern's head.
