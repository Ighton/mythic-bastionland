## Plans
- Confronted by [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight|Lady Deryn]] about abandoning Derwyn the squire.
- Players will head out to the west, in order to search for the "monster" that has been sighted around [[Aelyn's Gate]] ([[1. Myth of the Wyvern]]).

## Deryn's lesson
- Knights are summoned early in the morning to the castle forge. There, Lady Deryn is working, wearing a simple wool tunic and apron.
- She explains that blades must be tempered - strengthened, so that they will not fail in battle.
- She continues that a knight is to be the wall between the weak and the world. Word had reached her ears that the boy had been left by them.
- To leave a corpse of a sacred knight behind, to be scavenged by beasts, to let the boy wander the mountains alone, is unbefitting of any knight of this realm.
- If they will not be the wall they are charged to be, then neither will she.
- They are banished from this castle until they return with the head of the wyvern.
