Seat of power of the [[March of Dunwarr]], ruled by [[Prince Eurion, The Emerald Knight]]. A sizable city, and the largest settlement in the realm.

Prince Eurion, claiming old tradition, issues a decree reinstating the ritual of Thornbinding as a form of capital punishment. In it, victims are bound to a thorntree, whose vines slowly grow and embed themselves in the body of the victim. If they survive for a week, they are absolved.
