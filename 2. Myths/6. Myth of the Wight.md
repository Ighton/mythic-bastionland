## Omens
- [x] Beneath a grey willow, a young man washes a heap of clothes in a tiny pond. It’s the cleanest water in the Realm. He sings a song about “a Knight that fought death” but forgets most of the words.
- [ ] The Wight rides forth on their ghostly steed. They shout a challenge to single combat, the loser allowing the winner to drive a sword through their heart. The Wight knows that this won’t kill them.
- [ ] Creaking, gasping breath on the wind. The Wight hunches among a crown of jagged rocks. If disturbed they leap upon their steed and flee in shame.
- [ ] The Wight returns, another challenge of solo combat. Now the loser must allow the winner to burn them. The Wight tries to lose, but even fire does not kill them.
- [ ] An unmarked, recently dug grave. If disturbed the Wight bursts out and flees.
- [ ] A final challenge from the Wight, accompanied by a Seer. The Seer announces they will kill the winner in a horrible manner (see opposite).
