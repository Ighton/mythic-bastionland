## Omens
- [ ] A leech-collector weeps. In a nearby swamp the colossal thing snatched her
sister away with a bite. That bone-grinding noise haunts her.
- [ ] An argumentative sage complains. The balance of nature has been tipped. The birds aren’t behaving correctly and there’s not enough prey in the woods.
- [ ] A logging camp, crushed. Barrels of limeweed, a pungent appetite suppressor, left untouched. A Wurmshield surveys their master’s work with unearned pride.
- [ ] A stinking grey salt-bog. Grinding laughter can be heard on the wind as the Wurm sleeps below, dreaming of the next feast. Two Wurmshields keep watch, arguing over who is more loyal.
- [ ] The Wurm lounges on smashed burial  mounds of Seers. It speaks with four Wurmshields, loyal but poor company.
- [ ] The Wurm bursts from the ground, giving one opportunity for stimulating conversation before its great feast begins. It will not stop until bloated or dead.
