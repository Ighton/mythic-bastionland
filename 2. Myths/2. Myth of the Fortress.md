## Omens
- [x] The Thorn Seer roams the Realm, proclaiming an invasion of great scuttling monsters is coming soon.
- [ ] A messenger declares that the Thorn Seer has reclaimed a lost fortress (in the Myth Hex), creating an impenetrable sanctuary for when the invasion comes.
- [ ] Three claw swarm cutters peer from their tunnels, scouts for the invasion. If seen they scutter back underground.
- [ ] A smith and her three young apprentices are looking for a new home. They left the Fortress, as the Thorn Seer wanted the impossible from them, demanding whole walls of iron be built. 
- [ ] The voice of the Thorn Seer is heard across the land. The invasion is here, numberless hordes of the claw swarm attacking the Fortress. They will not actually breach the Fortress, as they are creations of the Thorn Seer.
- [ ] The invasion defeated, the Thorn Seer demands to be made ruler of the Realm, the Fortress as his Seat of Power.
