## Omens
- [ ] A half-asleep fisherman by a duckweed-covered pond. He warns the “old girl o’ the pond” can’t be trusted on her word.
- [ ] A pond thick with duckweed, the Sprite emerges, an old woman with the voice and movement of a child. She takes a liking to one member of the Company and asks lots about them before fleeing into the pond.
- [ ] Another weed-covered pond. The Sprite emerges in the centre, appearing serious. She asks her beloved to name any object they want, from the past, present, or future. She insists until they give an answer, then ducks back under water.
- [ ] Two beings of greenish water (see opposite) fight loudly, each proclaiming that “she loves only me”.
- [ ] A still lake, the green arms of the Sprite emerging on the bank, holding the requested item for their beloved. She attacks if the gift is refused.
- [ ] The Sprite, now angry, is here to reclaim the gift. She’ll take it by force if needed.
