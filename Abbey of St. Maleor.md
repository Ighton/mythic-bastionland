Monastery dedicated to the legendary [[St. Maleor]], victor of the [[Crusade of the Ashen See]]. Ruled by [[Father Avilius]], answers to the Patriarch of Vothos.

Six of the abbey's fourteen brothers and sisters have been slain. The remaining monks cower in fear, and [[Father Avilius]] is struggling for answers.

## Relations
**With [[Pembroke]]**: [[Sir Ceredig, The Gallows Knight]] has recently offered the abbot to inherit a small part of his lands, hoping to earn favor with the Divines. However, this has put him in bad standing with his own peoples.

Sir Ceredig's family, of Old Faith heritage, has long feuded with the abbots of the abbey. Ceredig's olive branch to Avilius is an attempt to reconcile this, though he might face consequences from his own family.

**With [[Bannockbry]]**: The second son of [[Prince Eurion]] has, just this spring, taken the monastical vows.

With the six dead brothers, Prince Eurion fears for his son's life. He has sent a regiment of soldiers to protect the abbey, though they have been disrespecting the sacred place.

**With [[Aelyn's Gate]]**: Secret/Mentor + Waterway/Tension
