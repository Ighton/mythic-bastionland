Traditional liturgical belief divides the world into 9 distinct eras, according to the teachings of the [[Church of the Four Divines]]. It is not truly known in which era man lives, though the texts of the church do describe a rough structure of the nine eras. As such, it is the duty of the Patriarch to interpret the descriptions and effectively 'deduce' or declare which era man is living in. Changing era also means resetting the years. Typically, a rollover thus occurs when the new year begins, though this is not strictly necessary.
# Overview of the Eras
## 1st Era
At the start of the first era, the world and the celestial sky was created by God from a roiling elemental chaos. He shaped order from chaos, and created heaven and hell. To watch over his new creation, he created man, who was to tend the world in his absence.
## 2nd Era
The second era began when man was first left alone on the world, as God retreated to the celestial realms, and left the angels in charge of heaven and the devils in charge of hell.
## 3rd Era
The third era began when the four divines, archangels from heaven, revealed themselves to mankind.
## 4th Era
A great war between the forces of chaos and the forces of order. It will end when the forces of order stand victorious.
## 5th Era
Division between the forces of man. A great schism. 
## 6th Era
The death of the heirs of God.
## 7th Era
The opening of the gates of chaos.
## 8th Era
The fall of the heavens - "When heaven and Earth collide".
## 9th Era
The end-times and the fall of man.

# Fringe beliefs
Though the church's official teachings remain that man lives in the 6th era, there are fringe groups who assert that man is actually living in another era. For instance, some point to the presence of demons and other elemental creatures on the material plane as proof that man is still living in the 4th era - after all, the forces of order do not yet stand victorious. Others interpret current events as having cataclysmic proportions, and believe man is already living in the 8th or 9th era.
