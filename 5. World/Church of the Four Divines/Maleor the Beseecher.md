**Maleor the Beseecher** (Maleor de Beroeper), later canonized as **St. Maleor** was a knight and diplomat living in the late 5th era. He is most known for organizing the [[Crusade of the Ashen See]], uniting the [[Tarinnian Dynasty (House)]] and the various noble houses of the [[Kingdom of Aranthia]] into reclaiming the [[Patriarchate of Vothos]], which had been all but conquered by raiding tribes several months earlier.

Maleor died at the end of the 5th era. He was canonized by [[Patriarch Plexor IV]] in 53, 6th era. 
## Life
### Early life
Maleor was born as son to a farmer's family. As a child, he took a keen interest in the [[Church of the Four Divines]], and was allegedly a frequent attendant of the village's church. During his younger years, he frequently visited and studied at the local covenant. At twelve, he took the [[Sacrament of Accession]], and joined the local church as a clergy-boy.
### Tarinn's wall
In his twenties, Maleor attended a vigil at a keep along Tarinnâ€™s Wall. The solemn devotion of the guardsmen left a lasting impression. Records show he enlisted initially as a clergyman, and later as a soldier.

Along with several soldiers from his keep, he joined to fight alongside the [[Patriarchate of Vothos]] in the [[War of the Aranthian Throne]]. According to tradition, Maleor raised an entire regiment from the brink of death after pleading for an intercession from God.
### Lord of Etienne
Upon return from war, the [[Patriarch of the Church of the Four Divines]] bestowed upon him a small piece of land that had recently come into the possession of the church after the victory in the [[War of the Aranthian Throne]].

Though Maleor was far from noble blood, the Patriach consecrated his bloodline, and he titled himself Lord of Etienne. Using his spoils from war, he transformed the county manor into a formidable keep. A community slowly arose around the keep, attracted by both the protection the keep offered as well as the miracle attributed to Maleor.
### Crusade of the Ashen See
See also *[[Crusade of the Ashen See]]*
In the late 5th era, the [[Patriarchate of Vothos]] was ransacked by raiding bandits. The patriarch, [[Patriarch Felix VI]], had run the country into deep debt. He could not afford soldiers or the maintenance of castles and walls. As a consequence, raiders plundered the basilica at [[Arcida]] and were on their way to loot the [[Sacred Palace]] in [[Vothos]].

An apathetic Tarinnian Dynasty and a chaos-stricken Aranthia both failed to come to the aid of the patriarchate. Leveraging his rare ties to both Tarinnian and Aranthian nobility, Maleor orchestrated a fragile but potent alliance to unite the two historically warring nations into marching towards the Palace at Vothos. The raiders were quickly overpowered by the united force.
### Later life and death
Maleor retired to his castle at Etienne, and remained relatively reclusive. After the crusade, his health quickly declined. He died at 64 years of age.
## Canonization
Maleor's miracle was recognized by [[Patriarch Plexor IV]] in the year 53, 6th era - some 70 years after Maleor's death. Consequently, he was canonized as a saint in the [[Church of the Four Divines]]. 

It is unclear whether Maleor's epitaph 'The Beseecher' refers to his miracle during the [[War of the Aranthian Throne]] or his diplomatic maneuvering that led to the [[Crusade of the Ashen See]]. 

The town of Etienne was renamed to [[St. Maleor, city of god]], in his honor.
## Patronage
St. Maleor is commonly depicted as a saint in traditional mail armor, wielding a sword in one hand and the [[Book of Divine Law]] in the other. He is considered a patron saint of knights, soldiers, healers and farmers. His feast day is the 24th of Summersebb, the day of the [[Relief of Vothos]].
