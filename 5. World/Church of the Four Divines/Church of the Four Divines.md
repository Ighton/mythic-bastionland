Multiple distinct churches worship the Four Divines. There was a great schism (or multipe) at some point.
## Core Theology
- The divine is singular in essence but plural in expression ([[Henotheism]]).
- Each of the Divines embodies an aspect that man must walk on the [[Path of Righteousness]]
- Worship is not competitive - to neglect one Divine is to be incomplete before the Divine.
- There are four divines: The Soldier, The Sage, The Judge, and The Healer.
- Balance is central: the warrior who forgets wisdom or justice becomes a butcher.
- Man and the Divine have a covenant, where they must protect and tend the world.
- Each of the Divines is all of the Divine, they are not divided, and they are not 'parts'. They are instead the divine seen through different aspects.
### Sin & Salvation
- Man was made in the image of the four divines, endowed with Wisdom, Courage, Justice, and Compassion.
- Sin is the notion of neglecting the divine, a shattering of the harmony of the soul.
- Salvation is restoring the balance within the soul.
### Aspects and Imagery
- The Divine is called **The Prism of Being**: white and whole, yet when cast into the world, shows itself as four colors.
- The Divine is **the Year Itself**: Winter is the Soldier (struggle), Spring is the Healer (renewal), Summer is the Sage (illumination), Autumn is the Judge (harvest and reckoning).
- The Divine is **the Cardinal Winds**: North (Soldier), East (Sage), South (Healer), West (Judge).
- The Divine is **the Four Great Stars**: said to be the Four Divines watching from the heavens.
## Structure
Each 'sect' is headed by a Triumvirate. A triumvirate consists of
**Patriarch** — Selected by the Bishops, in the position for life. In communion with God.
**Exarch** — Primes inter pares amongst the bishops. Elected amongst the bishops. Appointed until the Patriarch dies. Responsible for the 'daily' running of the church, communicating with Bishops, etc.
**Vicar (Vicaris Primatum)** — Chief judge and enforcer of ecclesiastical law. Head of the ecclesiastical court. Handles excommunication, etc. Appointed until the patriarch dies.

If an Exarch or Vicar dies, the Patriarch must commune with them through God, to enact their will. A new one is not appointed until the patriarch passes.
## History
### Founding
- In the 3rd era, four divine beings revealed themselves to mankind.
- They were a soldier, a sage, a judge, and a healer.
- They were the first saints and are archangels of heaven.
- Together, they wrote the [[Book of Divine Law]], containing the wisdom and teachings of God.
### War of Creation
### Great Schism
- Start of the 5th era
- Led to the creation of the [[Second Triumvirate]]
### Schism of Kyrathys
- Near the end of the 5th era.
- A 6-year-old boy from a rural village receives visions of God. The bishops notice this, and the boy becomes the youngest patriarch ever. 
- Since the boy-patriarch vastly outlived the exarch and vicar, he ruled alone for nearly 40 years. This ultimately led to the [[Schism of Kyrathys]], and the creation of the [[Third Triumvirate]].
### Fall of the First Triumvirate
- Start of the 6th era.
