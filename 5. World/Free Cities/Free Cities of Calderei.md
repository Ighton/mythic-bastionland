The Free Cities of Calderei are an accord of seven powerful cities in South-western Kyrathys. Though the cities are chiefly autonomous, they gather once a season on the [[Ancinnian Council]] to discuss their relations, each sending an envoy with entourage. One of the seven is elected Head of the Council during the spring session, and remains in this position for the remainder of the year. Typically, this honor is granted to Celia or Narim, the largest two cities of the accord.
## The Cities
- **[[St. Maleor, city of god]]** — The smallest of the cities, St. Maelor is a community built around the [[Castle of Maleor]]. It sits nestled on a hilltop in a defensive position and is home to 4,000 people.
- **Dis, city of secrets** — Dis is known for its occult trade. After the lands of Tarin, Dis is the greatest source of occult knowledge in the region.
- **Bale, city of thieves** — 
- **Kadyx, city of blood** — Kadyx is the home of the [[Coliseum of Blood]] and the [[Black Hand]], a ruthless mercenary order.
- **[[Tripon, city of ancients]]** — Bordering the [[Moors of Dynn]] is Tripon, an ancient city known for its druidic history.
- **[[Celia, city of spires]]** - Home to the Tower Arcane, Celia is a premier destination for those interested in the various magical arts. One of the few places in Western Kyrathys where spellcasting is common.
- **[[Narim, city of gold]]** — The northernmost city is Narim, known for its trade connections to the rest of the continent. If a thing can't be had here, it can't be had anywhere.
