*Fallen Prosperity, Sinking City*

Tripon is the southernmost city amongst the [[Free Cities of Calderei]]. It sits on the edge of the [[Moors of Dynn]]. It is central to the ancient beliefs of the people of Dynn, hence its name.
## History
It is said the city was founded by [[Marissa, The Banshee Queen]]. The locals still serve her, as a means to placate her and keep the moors safe. Throughout the town, shrines and temples to various [[Old Gods]] are common.

By 459, 6th Era, portions of the city had noticeably been sinking. Many believed this to be the wrath of the Banshee Queen, and many attempts to placate her were made. In 461, a vast stretch of the First Temple, along with a surrounding section of housing, collapsed into the ground entirely, sparking a panicked response.
## Politics
The city is ruled by [[Archdruid Daerios]], whose primary task is ensuring the safety of the city and placating the Banshee Queen. He is assisted by various secular councillors, who oversee the daily running of the city.
