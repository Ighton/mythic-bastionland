House of the Tarin Family, founded by the mythical [[King Tarin]]. It is uncertain whether he actually existed, though his supposed legacy is venerated by the current family, and the greater realm to a lesser extent.

The Tarin Dynasty has ruled over the lands south of the [[Dread Wastes]] for centuries. Their bloodline comprises the highest caste in the realm. Due to the strict caste system, and the desire to keep rule of the realm strictly within the family, inbreeding is very common. It is said that the family is not affected by this, due to an ancient pact made by [[King Tarin]]. It is through this pact that the Tarin family was first exposed to the occult arts, which they have only minimally shared with the lower classes.

The head of the House of Tarin, the oldest descendant of the previous head, has long heald the title of King of the Realm, and is thereby the formal head of state of the realm. However, the king holds very few lands personally, and is dependant on his direct vassals, the six despots, to accomplish anything.
