A fortified manor house, with several dozen dwellings within its walls. The surrounding lands serve as pasture and farmland. Ruled by [[Sir Ceredig, The Gallows Knight]].

The fortified manor is well-built, in Romanesque style of beige stone, with small windows adorned with pillars. The central hall is filthy, clearly unkempt for some time. In the center of the halls hangs a dusty chandelier, and the walls are adorned with wreaths from last winter.

A weak harvest has lead to a widespread famine across the holding. Sir Ceredig, fearing revolt, has put down any who speak up.

## Relations
**With [[Aelyn's Gate]]**: Harmonious/Successor  + Debt/Raids

**With [[Bannockbry]]**: Though [[Prince Eurion, The Emerald Knight]] greatly respects Sir Ceredig, the King has ordered the forced conversion of all Knights to the [[Church of the Four Divines]]. 

Hoping to swiftly end the matter, Eurion has sent an occupying force to Pembroke, demanding Ceredig converts.

**With [[Abbey of St. Maleor]]**: Sir Ceredig has recently offered the abbot, [[Father Avilius]], to inherit a small part of his lands, hoping to earn favor with the Divines. However, this has put him in bad standing with his own peoples.

Sir Ceredig's family, of Old Faith heritage, has long feuded with the abbots of the abbey. Ceredig's olive branch to Avilius is an attempt to reconcile this, though he might face consequences from his own family.
