A fortified manor house, with several dozen dwellings within its walls. The surrounding lands serve as pasture and farmland. Ruled by [[Lady Dorka, The Temple Knight]]. She is the oldest surviving child of [[Sir Ceredig, The Gallows Knight|Sir Ceredig]].

The fortified manor is well-built, in Romanesque style of beige stone, with small windows adorned with pillars. The central hall is filthy, clearly unkempt for some time. In the center of the halls hangs a dusty chandelier, and the walls are adorned with wreaths from last winter.

Skirmishes and disease have terrorized the manor. As a result, the holding is weak, unstable, and survives only through their alliance with [[Aelyn's Gate]]. Remnants of the [[Old Faith]] have gone into hiding. 
## Relations
**With [[Aelyn's Gate]]**: The two Knights have a strong bond, to the point where [[Sir Ceredig, The Gallows Knight|Sir Ceredig]]'s son sits on [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight|Lady Deryn]]'s council. The alliance between the two families goes back many generations.

Recently, due to the famine in [[Pembroke]], raiders have been pillaging the countryside. A few weeks ago, a caravan from [[Aelyn's Gate]] was brutally pillaged just a few hours away from [[Pembroke]]. Lady Deryn is furious, and is considering how to proceed.

**With [[Bannockbry]]**: Though [[Prince Eurion, The Emerald Knight]] greatly respects Sir Ceredig, the King has ordered the forced conversion of all Knights to the [[Church of the Four Divines]]. 

Hoping to swiftly end the matter, Eurion has sent an occupying force to Pembroke, demanding Ceredig converts.

**With [[Abbey of St. Maleor]]**: Sir Ceredig has recently offered the abbot, [[Father Avilius]], to inherit a small part of his lands, hoping to earn favor with the Divines. However, this has put him in bad standing with his own peoples.

Sir Ceredig's family, of Old Faith heritage, has long feuded with the abbots of the abbey. Ceredig's olive branch to Avilius is an attempt to reconcile this, though he might face consequences from his own family.
