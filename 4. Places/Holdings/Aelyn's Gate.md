A frontier castle, home to [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight]]. The central keep is adorned with a tall, dark spire. Within the walls sits a large open forum, considered sacred ground. Within the keep, a great hearth warms the great hall. Walls are adorned with scriptures from the [[Book of Divine Law]].

With Lady Deryn growing reclusive as she ages, her steward [[Sir Cadell]] has taken over in all  but name. With no heirs to her name, the title is likely to return to the Prince on her death.
## Relations
**With [[Pembroke]]**: The two Knights have a strong bond, to the point where [[Sir Ceredig, The Gallows Knight|Sir Ceredig]]'s son sits on [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight|Lady Deryn]]'s council. The alliance between the two families goes back many generations.

Recently, due to the famine in [[Pembroke]], raiders have been pillaging the countryside. A few weeks ago, a caravan from [[Aelyn's Gate]] was brutally pillaged just a few hours away from [[Pembroke]]. Lady Deryn is furious, and is considering how to proceed.

**With [[Bannockbry]]**: [[Prince Eurion, The Emerald Knight]] and Lady Deryn are both of common blood. Though their bloodlines have formally been consecrated, they each wield the secret as a weapon of last resort.

A failed marriage proposal between the two families, and the attempt on Lady Deryn's life, has led to the two families rivalry growing ever stronger. Recently, small scouting parties have fought skirmishes throughout the realm.

**With [[Abbey of St. Maleor]]**:
