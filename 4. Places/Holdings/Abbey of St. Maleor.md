Monastery dedicated to the legendary [[Maleor the Beseecher]], victor of the [[Crusade of the Ashen See]]. Ruled by [[Father Rhys]], answers to the Patriarch of Vothos.

[[Father Rhys]] has risen to this position from Court Chaplain of [[Aelyn's Gate]]. [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight|Lady Deryn]] was a great factor in this "promotion". With the [[Church of the Four Divines]] growing in the realm, the power of the abbot greatly grows.

## Recent News
- The abbey's prized reliquary has been stolen, The Beseechers's Sinister Hand. [[Father Rhys]] suspects that one of his own monks had a part to play, as the winter snows made the mountain hard to traverse.
- One of the senior monks has passed last week, with no apparent signs of illness. The brothers are wavering in their faith, now that the Beseecher's Hand no longer protects them.
## Relations
**With [[Pembroke]]**: [[Sir Ceredig, The Gallows Knight]] has recently offered the abbot to inherit a small part of his lands, hoping to earn favor with the Divines. However, this has put him in bad standing with his own peoples.

Sir Ceredig's family, of Old Faith heritage, has long feuded with the abbots of the abbey. Ceredig's olive branch to Avilius is an attempt to reconcile this, though he might face consequences from his own family.

**With [[Bannockbry]]**: The second son of [[Prince Eurion]] has, just this spring, taken the monastical vows.

With the six dead brothers, Prince Eurion fears for his son's life. He has sent a regiment of soldiers to protect the abbey, though they have been disrespecting the sacred place.
