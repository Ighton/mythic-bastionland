Seat of power of the [[Eastmark]], ruled by [[Prince Eurion, The Emerald Knight]]. A sizable city, and the largest settlement in the realm.

Outer towers are adorned with tall beacons, chimney-like constructions. They are overgrown and poorly-kept. The central bailey holds a small tomb in its cellar. In the great hall, a small podium of to the side is where musicians play. The walls are adorned with heraldry from the various rulers of Bannockbry.

Prince Eurion, claiming old tradition, issues a decree reinstating the ritual of Thornbinding as a form of capital punishment. In it, victims are bound to a thorntree, whose vines slowly grow and embed themselves in the body of the victim. If they survive for a week, they are absolved.

## Relations
**With [[Aelyn's Gate]]**: Eurion and [[Lady Deryn, The Dusk Knight]] are both of common blood. Though their bloodlines have formally been consecrated, they each wield the secret as a weapon of last resort.

A failed marriage proposal between the two families, and the attempt on Lady Deryn's life, has led to the two families rivalry growing ever stronger. Recently, small scouting parties have fought skirmishes throughout the realm.

**With [[Pembroke]]**: Though Eurion greatly respects [[Sir Ceredig, The Gallows Knight]], the King has ordered the forced conversion of all Knights to the [[Church of the Four Divines]]. 

Hoping to swiftly end the matter, Eurion has sent an occupying force to Pembroke, demanding Ceredig converts.


**With [[Abbey of St. Maleor]]**:  The second son of [[Prince Eurion]] has, just this spring, taken the monastical vows.

With the six dead brothers, Prince Eurion fears for his son's life. He has sent a regiment of soldiers to protect the abbey, though they have been disrespecting the sacred place.
