- A small plateau and cavern look out over the rough canyons below
- Inside the cavern resides [[The Needle Seer]]
- Tall and slender, festooned with blades.
- Pulls open small tears in reality, showing what could have been but is now impossible.
- Wants to make other people feel bad, but grudgingly does their duty to the Realm.
